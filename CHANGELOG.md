## [2.3.0] - 2024-02-??  - Minimal APIs (IdempotentAPI.MinimalAPI v3.0.0)
- The `AddIdempotentMinimalAPI(...)` extension is introduced to simplify the  `IdempotentAPI.MinimalAPI` registration with DI improvements by [@hartmark](https://github.com/hartmark).
    - IMPORTANT: To use the new extensions, the **BREAKING** `IdempotentAPI.MinimalAPI v3.0.0` should be used.
    - The new extensions register the following services:
    ```c#
    public static IServiceCollection AddIdempotentMinimalAPI(this IServiceCollection serviceCollection, IdempotencyOptions idempotencyOptions)
    {
        serviceCollection.AddSingleton<IIdempotencyAccessCache, IdempotencyAccessCache>();
        serviceCollection.AddSingleton<IIdempotencyOptions>(idempotencyOptions);
        serviceCollection.AddTransient(serviceProvider =>
        {
            var distributedCache = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IIdempotencyAccessCache>();
            var logger = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Idempotency>>();
            var idempotencyOptions = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IIdempotencyOptions>();

            return new Idempotency(
                distributedCache,
                logger,
                idempotencyOptions.ExpiresInMilliseconds,
                idempotencyOptions.HeaderKeyName,
                idempotencyOptions.DistributedCacheKeysPrefix,
                TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(idempotencyOptions.DistributedLockTimeoutMilli),
                idempotencyOptions.CacheOnlySuccessResponses,
                idempotencyOptions.IsIdempotencyOptional);
        });

        return serviceCollection;
    }
    ```
- Fix for Minimal API: When the special types (such as `HttpRequest`) are used as arguments, a Newtonsoft serialization exception for a self-referencing loop is thrown. The primary exception information is the following. Thank you to [@hartmark](https://github.com/hartmark) for reporting and investigating this issue ([#65](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/65)) 🙏.
    - `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializationException: Self referencing loop detected for property 'ServiceProvider' with type 'Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.ServiceProviderEngineScope'`

## [2.2.0] - 2023-12-26

### Added

- 🌟 Configure idempotency to be optional by setting the `IsIdempotencyOptional` option in the attribute. Thank you to  [@vIceBerg](https://github.com/vIceBerg), [@morgan35543](https://github.com/morgan35543), and [@SebastianBienert](https://github.com/SebastianBienert) for requesting this feature ([#56](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/56)) 🙏❤.
- 🌟 Use `double` milliseconds (`ExpiresInMilliseconds`) to define cache expiration instead of hours in integer.
  - ❗ The `ExpireHours` option is obsolete and will be deprecated. 
  - Thank you  [@vIceBerg](https://github.com/vIceBerg) for taking the time to report and implement this new feature ([#59](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/59)) 💪🙏.


### Fixed

- ✅ The request data hash always returns an empty byte array. This results in unwanted behavior because requests with different payloads and the same idempotency key are treated the same way. Thanks to **[@vaspopinex](https://github.com/vaspopinex)** for identifying and reporting this issue ([#58](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/58)) 🙏.


## [2.1.0] - 2023-06-11

### Added

- ❗ If you are updating from version `1.0.*`, this is a **BREAKING** change. In such a case, read the `2.0.0-RC.1` change log below.

- 🌟 All code uses `async` to avoid thread pool starvation in high-load scenarios. Thanks to [@dimmy-timmy](https://github.com/dimmy-timmy) for implementing it ([#47](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/pull/47)) 🙏.

- 🌟The `IdempotentAPI.MinimalAPI` is introduced to use `IdempotentAPI` in Minimal APIs. Just add the `IdempotentAPIEndpointFilter` in your endpoints. Thank to [@hartmark](https://github.com/hartmark) for implementing it ([#45](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/pull/45)) 🙏.

  - ```c#
    app.MapPost("/example",
        ([FromQuery] string yourParam) =>
        {
            return Results.Ok(new ResponseDTOs());
        })
        .AddEndpointFilter<IdempotentAPIEndpointFilter>();
    ```

- ✅ GitHub actions configuration added to run CI build and test on pull requests. Thanks to [@dimmy-timmy](https://github.com/dimmy-timmy) 💪.

- ✅ Integration Tests are improved to run on CI using `WebApplicationFactory`. Thanks to [@dimmy-timmy](https://github.com/dimmy-timmy) 💪.



## [2.0.0-RC.1] - 2022-10-02 - BREAKING

### Fixed

- ✅ There were two cases in which the IdempotentAPI didn't respond as expected. For that reason, we made some corrections and improvements. Thanks to [@kvuong](https://github.com/khoavn) for reporting this issue ([#37](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/37)) 💪🙏.

  - When the controller returns a non-successful response (4xx, 5xx,  etc.), the IdempotentAPI cache the error response. In some cases, maybe we would like this behavior. For that reason, we have added the `CacheOnlySuccessResponses` attribute option to set it per case (default value: `True`).
  - When an exception occurs in the controller, the IdempotentAPI stack is in the in-flight mode by returning a `409 Conflict` response in the subsequent requests. Thus, we have made a fix to remove the in-flight request on exceptions.
  - However, as long as a request is in inflight mode (running), all other requests will still get a `409 Conflict` response. For that reason, we should be careful when configuring the request timeout.
- ✅ There was a bug when a request body was big enough (e.g., 30kb+). The cache couldn't appropriately be fetched because of a different hash string. Thanks, [@bernardiego](https://github.com/bernardiego), for taking the time to report and provide a fix for this issue ([#38](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/38)) 🙏❤.
- ✅ Fix a bug in the reconstruction of the `ObjectResult` responses. Thanks to [@MohamadTahir](https://github.com/MohamadTahir) for reporting this issue ([#39](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/39)) and providing a workaround 🙏.

### Added

- ❗ The `CacheOnlySuccessResponses` attribute option is included (default value: `True`) to cache only 2xx HTTP responses.

- 🌟 Support idempotency in a **Cluster Environment** (i.e., a group of multiple server instances) using **Distributed Locks**. Refactoring has been performed to include additional abstractions and distinguish the Caching (`IIdempotencyCache`), Distributed Locks (`IDistributedAccessLockProvider`), and Accessing of them (`IIdempotencyAccessCache`). Thanks to [@Rast1234](https://github.com/Rast1234) for showing the need for this feature 💪🙏. Currently, we support the following two implementations. 

  - 🌟 The `DistributedLockTimeoutMilli` attribute option is included to configure the time the distributed lock will wait for the lock to be acquired (in milliseconds).

### Changed

- ❗ **IMPORTANT**: We should register the IdempotentAPI Core services.

  - ```c#
    services.AddIdempotentAPI();
    ```

- ❗ **IMPORTANT**: The `IdempotentAPI.Cache` has been renamed to `IdempotentAPI.Cache.Abstractions`. So, you should remove the `IdempotentAPI.Cache` NuGet package and use the `IdempotentAPI.Cache.Abstractions` when needed.
- Dependency Updates

  - Update `Newtonsoft.Json` from `12.0.3` to `13.0.1`.
  - Update `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions` from `3.1.21` to `6.0.0`.
  - Update `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions` from `3.1.22` to `6.0.0`.
  - Update `ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache` from `0.1.7` to `0.13.0`.
  - Update `ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache.Serialization.NewtonsoftJson` from `0.1.7` to `0.13.0`.



## [1.0.1] - 2022-03-12

### Fixed
- Idempotency did not work as expected when the return type on the controller action was a custom object and not an `ActionResult`. ([#33](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/33))
- Thanks to @MohamadTahir for reporting and investigating this issue 🙏.



## [1.0.0-RC.1] - 2022-01-18 - BREAKING
### Added
- 📝 This `CHANGELOG.md` file quickly shows the notable changes we have performed between the project's releases (versions).

- 🌟 Support for ASP.NET Core 5.0 and 6.0 by stopping using the [obsolete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/5.0/binaryformatter-serialization-obsolete) `BinaryFormatter` and using the `Newtonsoft JsonSerializer` ([recommended action](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/5.0/binaryformatter-serialization-obsolete#recommended-action)).

- 🌟 Define the `IIdempotencyCache` interface to decide which caching implementation is appropriate in each use case. Currently, we support the following two implementations. However, you can use your implementation 😉.

  |                                                | Support Concurrent Requests | Primary Cache     |      2nd-Level Cache       | Advanced features |
  | ---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------: | ----------------- | :------------------------: | :---------------: |
  | IdempotentAPI.Cache.DistributedCache (Default) |              ✔️              | IDistributedCache |             ❌              |         ❌         |
  | IdempotentAPI.Cache.FusionCache                |              ✔️              | Memory Cache      | ✔️<br />(IDistributedCache) |         ✔️         |

- 🌟 Support the [FusionCache](https://github.com/jodydonetti/ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache), which provides high performance and robust cache with an optional distributed 2nd layer and some advanced features.

  - `FusionCache` also includes some advanced features like a **fail-safe** mechanism, **cache stampede** prevention, fine grained **soft/hard timeouts** with **background factory completion**, **extensive** customizable logging, and [more](https://github.com/jodydonetti/ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache#heavy_check_mark-features).

- ⚙ Configure the logging level of the `IdempotentAPI` logs that we would like to keep. For example, as we can see in the following JSON, we can set `IdempotentAPI.Core.Idempotency` in the `appsettings.json`.

  ```json
  {
    "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information",
        "IdempotentAPI.Core.Idempotency": "Warning"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Changed
- The Logger name is changed from `IdempotencyAttributeFilter` to `Idempotency`. Thus, in the `appsettings.json` file we should configure the logging level using the name `IdempotentAPI.Core.Idempotency` e.g., `"IdempotentAPI.Core.Idempotency": "Information"`.
- Dependencies of `IdempotentAPI`:
  - Remove `Microsoft.AspNetCore (2.2.0)`.
  - Remove `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Abstractions (2.2.0)`.
  - Remove `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions (2.2.0)`.
  - Update `Newtonsoft.Json` from `12.0.2` to `12.0.3`.
### Fixed
- 🌟 Prevent concurrent requests in our default caching implementation (IdempotentAPI.Cache.DistributedCache).
### Thanks to
- @fjsosa for proposing a workaround to use `IdempotentAPI` in ASP.NET Core 5.0 and 6.0 in the meantime ([#17](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/17)) 🙏.
- @william-keller for reporting the [#23](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/23) and [#25](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/25) issues 🙏❤.



## [0.2.3-beta] - 2021-10-15
### Fixed
- Issue: An `Invalid character in chunk size error` occurs on the second request when using the Kestrel server ([#21](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/21)). For that purpose, we are not caching the `Transfer-Encoding` in the first request (excluded from cache).
- Thanks to @apchenjun and @william-keller for reporting and helping solve this issue 💪🙏.



## [0.2.1-beta] - 2021-07-12
### Added
- Handle inflight (concurrent and long-running) requests. In such cases, the subsequent exact requests will get a `409 Conflict` response.

### Fixed
- Issue: Duplication on concurrent requests with the same key ([#19](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/19)).
- Thanks to @lvzhuye and @RichardGreen-IS2 for reporting and [fixing](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/pull/20) the issue 🙏❤.



## [0.2.0-beta] - 2021-06-19
### Added
- A sample project is added (using .NET Core 3.1).

### Fixed
- Issue: Accessing form data throws an exception when the Content-Type is not supported ([#14](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI/issues/14)).
- Thanks to @apchenjun for reporting the issue 🙏.



## [0.1.0-beta] - 2019-11-04
### Added
- Support idempotency by implementing an ASP.NET Core attribute (`[Idempotent()]`) by which any HTTP write operations (POST and PATCH) can have effect only once for the given request data.
- Use the `IDistributedCache` to cache the appropriate data. In this way, you can register your implementation, such as Memory Cache, SQL Server cache, Redis cache, etc.
- Set different options per controller or/and action method via the `Idempotent` attribute, such as:
  - `Enabled` (default: true): Enable or Disable the Idempotent operation on an API Controller's class or method.
  - `ExpireHours` (default: 24): The cached idempotent data retention period.
  - `HeaderKeyName` (default: `IdempotencyKey`): The name of the Idempotency-Key header.
  - `DistributedCacheKeysPrefix` (default: `IdempAPI_`): A prefix for the key names that we will use in the `DistributedCache`.
